Project mission: Maintain and extend a static web app that converts flat fill colors in SVGs from RGB to CMYK using a user-defined mapping. Stack: vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no build step.
Rules:
– Keep code self-contained in index.html, style.css, script.js.
– Only support flattened fills (no gradients/patterns/CSS) for now.
– Add tests by shipping minimal sample SVGs in the repo.
– Create small, focused PRs with clear commit messages and acceptance notes.
First task: Add drag-and-drop upload, basic error handling, and a sample SVG + README usage notes.
